# Flutter Particle Clock

For my entry in the [Flutter Clock Challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock) I wanted to build something colorful, animated and playful that changes appearance with time. Ideally, I wanted it to look different every time I looked at it. I also wanted to explore the custom painting features of Flutter. üë®‚Äçüé®

I ended up with an analog watch face featuring a simple particle system. It randomizes the color palettes while also maintaining legibility by calculating the luminance in real-time.

Building this was a bit of a struggle as I'm not very good with math, but the framework and the developer experience (hot reload, in particular) helped me out a lot. Being able to iterate quickly is a great way to learn new things. I guess the code could be improved in several ways, both in terms of elegance and performance. However, I've managed to easily stay far below the 16ms/frame benchmark (average 5ms/frame on my iPad while debugging). Flutter's rendering engine performs fantastically, even with my horrible math! üòÖ

## Highlights

  - üé® Randomly selects color palettes while still maintaining legibility at all times.
  - üå§ Supports both **light mode** and **dark mode**, by filtering background color by luminance.
  - üì± Scales to fit the screen space available and adjust calculations & rendering accordingly.
  - üöÄ At least 60 FPS on modern devices.
  - üåà Constantly shifting and moving, making it fun to look at.
